# Finding Donors For CharityML
Investigated factors that affect the likelihood of charity donations being made based on real census data.
# Project Brief
In this project I applied three different supervised learning techniques on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause.<br>
I first explored the data, then applied series of preprocessing techniques to prepare the data for the training process. I then evaluated several supervised learners of my choice, and considered which is best suited for the solution. Finally I tuned the best model out of the three and compared the results after/before tuning.
